# Privacy Policy for Pulse Play

**Last updated: January 9, 2025**

## Overview

Pulse Play is a Chrome extension designed to provide instant video playback speed control. This privacy policy explains how we handle data in our extension.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any user data.** Pulse Play operates entirely locally on your device and does not:

- Collect personally identifiable information
- Track your browsing history
- Monitor your web activity
- Access website content beyond video elements
- Transmit any data to external servers
- Store any personal information

## Data Usage

The extension only stores user preferences locally in your browser, including:

- Hotkey configurations
- Speed multiplier preferences
- Visual indicator settings
- Platform-specific enable/disable options

This data remains on your device and is never transmitted elsewhere.

## Permissions

### activeTab Permission

Used to access the currently active tab when the extension popup is opened. This allows us to determine if video speed controls should be enabled and inject our content script only when needed.

### storage Permission

Used to save and retrieve user preferences locally in your browser. This enables the extension to remember your customizations across browser sessions.

### Host Permissions (https://_/_ and http://_/_)

Required to detect and control video players across various websites. The extension only accesses video elements and does not read or collect any other website content.

## Third-Party Data Sharing

We do not sell, transfer, or share any user data with third parties. The extension operates entirely offline and does not communicate with external servers.

## Data Security

Since no data is collected or transmitted, there are no data security concerns. All user preferences are stored locally using Chrome's secure storage API.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
